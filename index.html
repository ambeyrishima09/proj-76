    <div id="text"><p>Our Sun is one of at least 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, a spiral galaxy about 100,000 light-years across. The stars are arranged in a pinwheel pattern with four major arms, and we live in one of them, about two-thirds of the way outward from the center.
    <br>Most of the stars in our galaxy are thought to host their own families of planets. Thousands of these exoplanets have been discovered so far, with thousands more candidates detected and awaiting confirmation. Many of these newly discovered planetary systems are quite different from our own.
        All of the stars in the Milky Way orbit a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center, which is estimated to be four million times as massive as our Sun. Fortunately, it is a safe distance from Earth, at around 28,000 light-years away. Our galaxy is one of the billions in the universe, each having millions, or more frequently billions, of stars of its own.</p>
